# Lecture 65: Chaining multiple middleware functions

Say that we want the http requests such as post to have multiple middleware? So how do we change them?
We do it like this

    router
    .route('/')
    .get(tourController.getAllTours)
    .post(tourController.checkBody, tourController.createTour);

Rhe checkBody method middleware will be applied before the createTours
